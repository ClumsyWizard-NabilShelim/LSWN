# Life-Starts-With-Nothing
This is my first ever game jam game and was submitted for Ludum dare 45, I joined jam so I got 3 days to work on my game but you also have the option to join compo in which you get 2 days. In this game, you are a square who completed university and starts fighting....... other squares and your weapon randomly switches between a gun and a shield because that's exactly what happens in real life.

Made using:

 - Unity Game Engine.
 - C# programming engine.
 - Bfxr for sound effects.
 - Aseprite for pixel art.
